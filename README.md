# Build It Bigger

In this project, an app was created with 2 flavors (paid and free) that uses
multiple libraries and Google Could Endpoints. The app consists
of four modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Could Endpoints
(GCE) project that serves those jokes, an Android Library containing an
activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from the
GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.

## Usage

Simply click button to display various (computer related) jokes via a toast.
